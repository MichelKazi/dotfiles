# dotfiles

Here are my dotfiles.  
There are a few things that have to be done manually still... 
but this repo should serve to set up a comfortable development environment.  

### For Arch/Manjaro
Setup is pretty simple for arch.  
If you run the `install.sh` script with the `--source` flag, make sure you cloned this repo into you home directory.
