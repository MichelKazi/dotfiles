# Michel's Dotfiles

I like configuring things a lot.  

## Branches
- [Master](https://github.com/MichelKazi/dotfiles)
- [devbox3488](https://github.com/MichelKazi/dotfiles/tree/devbox3488)

Copying my configurations is as easy as $git clone https://github.com/michelkazi/dotfiles.git$ 
Then just source the files.  
If certain things aren't installed that the configurations depend on, just delete the lines or install them :)
